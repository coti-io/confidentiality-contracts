# MpcCore.sol

This Solidity library, `MpcCore`, provides core functionalities for secure multi-party computation (MPC) using the COTI protocol.  

Below is an overview of its components and functions:


## Legend

- it = input text. This structure contains text that was encrypted by user and provided a signature to authenticate it.
- gc = garbled text
- ct = cipher text
- ut = user text. This structure  contains 2 types of cipher texts: one by the network and one by the user key. Convenient for operations that require some times to decipher one or another.

## Types
The library defines several custom types using `uint256` as the base type:
- `gtBool`, `gtUint8`, `gtUint16`, `gtUint32`, `gtUint64`
- `ctBool`, `ctUint8`, `ctUint16`, `ctUint32`, `ctUint64`
- `lenghts`, use to differentiate the length

## Structures
The library defines multiple structures for handling encrypted and signed data:
- `itBool`, `itUint8`, `itUint16`, `itUint32`, `itUint64`: Each structure contains a inputtext (`ctBool`, `ctUint8`, etc.) and a signature (`bytes`).
- `utBool`, `utUint8`, `utUint16`, `utUint32`, `utUint64`: Each structure contains two usertext (`ctBool`, `ctUint8`, etc.) for user and regular data.

## Enums
- `MPC_TYPE`: Enum to represent different MPC data types (`SBOOL_T`, `SUINT8_T`, `SUINT16_T`, `SUINT32_T`, `SUINT64_T`).
- `ARGS`: Enum to represent different argument types (`BOTH_SECRET`, `LHS_PUBLIC`, `RHS_PUBLIC`).

## Functions
### Enum Combination Functions
These functions combine enum values into bytes for efficient storage and transfer:
- `combineEnumsToBytes2(MPC_TYPE mpcType, ARGS argsType)`: Combines an `MPC_TYPE` and `ARGS` into a `bytes2` value.
- `combineEnumsToBytes3(MPC_TYPE mpcType1, MPC_TYPE mpcType2, ARGS argsType)`: Combines two `MPC_TYPE` values and an `ARGS` value into a `bytes3` value.
- `combineEnumsToBytes4(MPC_TYPE mpcType1, MPC_TYPE mpcType2, MPC_TYPE mpcType3, ARGS argsType)`: Combines three `MPC_TYPE` values and an `ARGS` value into a `bytes4` value.

### Overflow and Result Validation
- `checkOverflow`: Validates whether an overflow has occurred in a cryptographic operation.
- `checkRes8`, `checkRes16`, `checkRes32`, `checkRes64`: Check the result for different bit sizes (8, 16, 32, and 64 bits).

### Key Management Functions
- `getUserKey(bytes calldata signedEK, bytes calldata signature)`: Retrieves the user's AES encryption key in encrypted format, by using the provided public key to encrypt it - signature is used to validate the account ownership.
- `deleteUserKey`: Deletes a userâ€™s cryptographic key.

This library is designed to be used as part of a secure multi-party computation framework, facilitating the handling and combination of encrypted and signed data types.

### Ciphertext Validation and Decryption
- `validateCiphertext`: Validates the integrity of a ciphertext.
- `decrypt`: Decrypts a given ciphertext.

### Onboarding and Offboarding Users
- `onBoard`: Adds a user to the MPC protocol, loading data from `ct` type to `gt` type.
- `offBoard`: Removes a user from the MPC protocol, transforming data from `gt` type to `ct` type.
- `offBoardToUser`: Transfers data ownership to a user during offboarding; transforms from `gt` type to `ct` type previously prepared by the user's AES key rather than the MPC one.
- `offBoardCombined`: Combines offboarding actions for multiple users, offboarding to both the user's AES key and the network's AES key.

### Setting Public Keys
- `setPublic`: Sets a public key for cryptographic operations, taking data that was sent to the contract in as `ct` and transforming it to `gt`.
- `setPublic8`, `setPublic16`, `setPublic32`, `setPublic64`: Sets public keys for specific bit sizes (8, 16, 32, and 64 bits).

### Random Number Generation
- `rand`, `rand8`, `rand16`, `rand32`, `rand64`: Generate random numbers of various bit sizes.
- `randBoundedBits8`, `randBoundedBits16`, `randBoundedBits32`, `randBoundedBits64`: Generates bounded random numbers within a specified range for different bit sizes.

### Logical and Comparison Operations
- `and`, `or`, `xor`: Perform bitwise operations.
- `eq`, `ne`, `ge`, `gt`, `le`, `lt`: Perform comparison operations (equality, inequality, greater than, less than, etc.).

### Mathematical Operations
- `add`, `checkedAdd`, `sub`, `checkedSub`, `mul`, `checkedMul`, `div`, `rem`: Perform mathematical operations, with both standard and overflow-checked versions available.
- `min`, `max`: Return the minimum or maximum of two values.

### Data Transfer Operations
- `transfer`, `transferWithAllowance`: Facilitate data or token transfer operations between accounts.

### Multiplexer and Logical Negation
- `mux`: Implements a multiplexer operation (conditional value selection).
- `not`: Implements a bitwise NOT operation.

# MpcInterface.sol
